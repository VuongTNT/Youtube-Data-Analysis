The NYPD later identified him as 26-year-old Luigi Mangione and said he had a manifesto on his person that speaks to his possible alleged motivation in the killing. They said that manifesto included no specific threats to others, but noted \"it does seem he does have some ill will towards corporate America.\"\n\nNBC New York's Marc Santia, Jonathan Dienst and Jessica Cunnington report.",

This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work… and of himself.\n\nIn season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\n\nSeason 2 reunites its ensemble cast of stars including Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette, and welcomes new series regular Sarah Bock.\n\nSeverance is executive produced by Ben Stiller, who also directs five episodes this season in addition to directors Uta Bresiewitz, Sam Donovan and Jessica Lee Gagné. The series is written, created and executive produced by Dan Erickson. Severance season two is also executive produced by John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Sam Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, Nicholas Weinstock.

        "description": "Ashley Pointer | December 6, 2024\nDoechii, known as the \"Swamp Princess,\" arrived at NPR HQ radiating confidence. She moved with purpose, knowing exactly what she wanted and how to achieve it. Her declarative statement, \"I'm everything,\" from \"BOOM BAP\" off her Grammy-nominated mixtape, ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, was on full display in her Tiny Desk debut.\n\nBacked by a full band, horns and two background singers, Doechii's performance was a masterclass in creativity. Sporting vintage academia looks, complete with matching cornrows and beads, Doechii delivers a freshly rearranged medley of cuts from ALLIGATOR BITES NEVER HEAL, tailored specifically for Tiny Desk. While hip-hop remained at the core, she truly gave us everything: a jazz arrangement of \"BOOM BAP,\" heavy rock vibes on \"CATFISH\" and a Southern praise break outro on \"NISSAN ALTIMA.\"\n\nShe closed her set with \"Black Girl Memoir\" from her debut album, Oh The Places You'll Go. Before performing, she shared, \"I wrote this song specifically for Black women. As a dark-skinned woman, there's a very unique experience I'm trying to internalize … This is dedicated to all the beautiful Black women in the room.\" While her star has been steadily on the rise since her debut, 2024 is shaping up to be the year Doechii cements herself as a household name.\n\nSET LIST\n\"BOOM BAP\"\n\"BOILED PEANUTS\"\n\"DENIAL IS A RIVER\"\n\"CATFISH\"\n\"NISSAN ALTIMA\"\n\"BULLFROG\"\n\"HIDE N SEEK\"\n\"Black Girl Memoir\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDoechii: vocals\nTyler Victoria: guitar\nDee Simone: drums\nTatiana Tate: trumpeter, arrangement\nHammondgal: keyboards \nDJ Miss Milan: vocals\nBREN'NAE: background vocals\nEmmani: background vocals\nKeschia Potter : saxophone\nZuri Appleby: bassist\nSlimWav: musical direction\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducers: Ashley Pointer, Bobby Carter\nDirector/Editor: Joshua Bryant\nAudio Technical Director: Josh Newell\nVideographers: Joshua Bryant, Kara Frame, Sofia Seidel, Wendy Li\nAudio Engineer: Josephine Nyounai\nProduction Assistant: Elle Mannion\nPhotographer: Alanté Serene\nTiny Desk Team: Maia Stern, Hazel Cills\nExecutive Producer: Suraya Mohamed\nSeries Creators: Bob Boilen, Stephen Thompson\nVP, Visuals and Music: Keith Jenkins\n\n#nprmusic #tinydesk #doechii \n\nSupport for NPR Music comes from Better Help, committed to making mental well-being a priority\nand offering support in taking on everything life demands.

Competing in the Premier League - the top division of English football, the club has had many successes, winning five Premier League titles. The club won their first major honour, the League championship in 1955, followed by the FA Cup in 1970, their first European honour, the Cup Winners' Cup in 1971, and became the third English club to win the Club World Cup in 2022. \n\nAs the Pride of London, Chelsea FC is one of the most success clubs in terms of overall trophies won. They are the only club to have won all three major European competitions twice and have taken the crown domestically, winning six league titles, eight FA Cups, five League Cups, and four FA Community Shields. Internationally, Chelsea have won the UEFA Champions League, the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup twice each, and the FIFA Club World Cup once since their inception.\n\nThe Chelsea YouTube channel provides access to all the build-up, training and behind-the-scenes moments and matchday action along with all the unseen edits and player focus from Reece James, Cole Palmer and Enzo Fernandez to Sam Kerr, Lauren James and many more. It’s the only channel where you’ll get an authentic look at this great club including memorable nights with world-class heroes such as Peter Osgood, Gianfranco Zola, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba & Eden Hazard.",

I don't really know much about D&D, so I based it more off classic Zelda dungeons.

Nevermind the fact that Series 27 releases in 2025, we're still going strong building LEGO dungeons and castles for this year! Not sure when I'm going to start 27-Ville (or 26-Ville for that matter), but I've definitely got plans!\n\nLEGO Shop-at-Home website:\n🇺🇸▶https://bit.ly/3AmSA2L 🇬🇧▶https://bit.ly/3unDDJU\n🇨🇦▶https://bit.ly/3OK3HXL 🇦🇺▶https://bit.ly/3at2oxx\n(Links may be affiliate and buying something gives me a small commission\nat no additional cost to you.

        "title": "Galaxy Quest Review",
        "description": "Mike and Jack sit down to talk about the cult classic film “Galaxy Quest” starring Tim Allen and many others. A film that has gained popularity over the years and days since it was released. Mike and Jack come at this film with different perspectives, while both appreciating it as the wonderful magical fun adventure film it is with fantastic visual FX and monsters, Jack sees the film as the memorable movie he grew up with and helped to mold his love for cinema and acting. Mike (being 37 years older than Jack) sees the film as a magical what-could-have-been kind of thing. He smells the studio meddling like a wet fart from afar.  The potential for a PG-13 or R rated dry, vulgar comedy was there, but watered down by a spineless studio that wanted to G-rated Tim Allen comedy. Would it have flopped as a more adult film? Would it have been better if they went full kids tale? Don’t ya know no one will ever know! It’s a slippery pig that’s been oiled up with K-Y jelly. Mike tries to grab a hold of that piggy to see what it done be. Jack is happy with what the movie is. Mike can’t see the forest through the trees. He loves all the moments in the film. So many good moments and character choices and fun gags. But at what cost? Who done they make this movie for? Trek fans love it. But maybe not all Trek fans love it? I don't know. Kids and Parents of all ages love it. The elderly would love it if they weren’t dead. Even foreign folks from other nations love it. What would it have been if it was made with the TOS Star Trek actors or even the TNG actors. I for one am glad it was not. While a fun \"what if\" to think about it, it would have broken the 4th wall to a degree that would have been too much. They could get away with it in that one movie Wes Craven's New Nightmare, but that's just a Freddy movie. Not super important. Certainly not as much has Star Trek. Anyways, Galaxy Quest does indeed work as a movie. It tells the timeless tale of characters who are less than great and struggle to know themselves are thrust into a challenge and have to find it in themselves to be better and make the difference. Campbell’s Soup calls it the Hero’s Journey with Chicken and Stars. Extra noodles please!",

        "title": "How Shopping Malls Are Being Transformed Into Apartments In The U.S.",
        "description": "While many U.S. malls face anchor store closures and empty parking lots, some are finding new life by becoming housing. Real estate developers are building housing inside of or next to shopping malls as department stores like Macy’s, JCPenney and Sears shrink or cease to exist. At least 192 U.S. malls planned to add housing to their footprint as of January 2022. Dozens of apartment projects at malls are underway in California, Colorado, Florida, Arizona and Texas. The trend not only helps to chip away the housing shortage in the U.S., but also brings people closer to the remaining retail and restaurant spaces in shopping centers. CNBC visited a Macerich housing project at Flatiron Crossing Mall in Broomfield, Colorado as well as the Arcade Mall in Providence, Rhode Island to find out what it is like to live inside a mall.\n\nChapters:\n0:00 Introduction\n2:13: Chapter 1 - Living in a mall\n4:45: Chapter 2 - The new anchor store: housing\n6:59: Chapter 3 - Challenges\n\nCREDITS\nProduced by: DeLon Thornton\nSenior Producer and Camera: Shawn Baldwin\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller\nReporter: Gabrielle Fonrouge\nGraphics by: Jason Regniato\nAdditional Camera: Juliana Broste\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\n\n\n» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC \n» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision \n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

V continues Bing Crosby’s legacy of iconic holiday duets—marking 47 years since Bing Crosby’s last cross-generational collaboration with David Bowie in 1977.\n \nArriving just in time for the holiday season, the duet reflects V’s long-standing admiration for Bing Crosby, expressed through social media posts and content. This led to playful exchanges with Bing Crosby's legacy, sparking excitement and anticipation among ARMY (BTS’ official fandom).\n \nWith winter drawing near, the heartfelt collaboration aims to connect fans and listeners worldwide, enveloping them in the warmth and joy of the holiday season to celebrate the magic of “White Christmas” and the enduring power of music that transcends time.\n \nSign up for Bing Crosby’s newsletter for updates & exclusive content: bingcrosby.com/newsletter/\nConnect with Bing Crosby:\ninstagram.com/bingcrosby/\nfacebook.com/officialbingcrosby/\ntwitter.com/bingcrosby\ntiktok.com/@bingcrosbyofficial\n \nConnect with BTS: \nhttps://ibighit.com/bts\nhttp://x.com/BTS_bighit\nhttp://x.com/BTS_twt\n  / bangtan.official  \n  / bangtantv  \n   / bts.bighitofficial  \n  / bts_official_bighit  \nhttps://weverse.onelink.me/qt3S/94808190\nhttps://www.weibo.com/BTSbighit\nhttp://btsblog.ibighit.com\n \n#AVeryVChristmas #WhiteChristmasWithBingV #BingXV #V #뷔",

        "description": "The first-ever episode of Not Gonna Lie presented by Dunkin’ is officially here and Kylie has a lot to catch you up on since the “Kelce” documentary and her appearance on “that other podcast taping in the other room.”\n\nKylie starts things off by thanking all of you for your overwhelming support of the show announcement and trailer. But don’t think she didn’t also notice some of the commentary about her swearing in front of her kids…\n\nKylie then does her own spin on the game “20 Questions” she calls “5-ish Questions” because she’s a mom and nobody has time for 20 questions! Kylie talks about her recent pregnancy announcement, gives her thoughts on gender reveals, shares what the past two years have been like and also reveals which incredible place she felt she had the least business being.\n\nKaitlin Olson then joins the show to talk to Kylie after being the winning bidder on her signed Eagles jacket. Kylie and Kaitlin discuss the differences between raising all boys vs. raising all girls and moments they had early on in motherhood where they didn’t know what they were doing. \n\nKaitlin also talks about her new show “High Potential” on ABC and branching out to roles that differ from “Sweet Dee” on “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Plus, staying true to the premise of the show, Kylie reveals an “It’s Always Sunny” related admission to Kaitlin.\n\nAs Kylie mentions in this episode, you can find even more exclusive, never-before-seen clips from her conversation with Kaitlin on YouTube throughout the week. Make sure to subscribe so you don’t miss a thing!\n.\n.\n.\nDownload the full podcast here:\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/not-gonna-lie-with-kylie-kelce/id1780888125\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/0RgXbSGGmwpzAyeLHbDqUD?si=4585dab89c4f4c11&nd=1&dlsi=e178bf324b99403f\n\nFollow Not Gonna Lie on Social Media for all the best moments from the show: \nlnk.to/j61XD8\n\nSupport the Show:  \n\nDUNKIN’: Try Kylie’s favorite Butter Pecan Iced Coffee at your local Dunkin’!

The video shows the entire project which took 2 and a half months of work. It begins with the making of a thatched A-frame hut as a workshop for making tiles. The tiles were made from clay and fired in a kiln made from bricks made in previous videos. A 2x2 m hut was then built by making two walls of mud in the shape of a wall and gable. Between 1.25 and 1.6 tons of soil were used to make these walls. The roof was formed by spanning the two walls with timber that was then covered with tiles. The hut shed rain reasonably well but it remains to be seen how it will fair in the long wet season which is starting now. The main benefit of this hut is how little material is used in the walls considering that there are no side walls, significantly reducing labor and materials. It will be an experiment in how this building method works.\n\n00:00 - Building the tile workshop\n05:20 - Clay preparation\n08:11 - Making roof tiles\n12:18 - Building kiln\n13:53 - Fire by friction\n15:46 - Stacking kiln\n17:20 - Firing tile batch 1\n18:47 - Result and water test\n20:51 - Firing tile batch 2\n24:18 - Firing tile batch 3 (plus small pot)\n27:31 - Making next round of tiles\n32:16 - Building the hut foundations\n33:31 - Building mud walls\n35:15 - Protecting walls from rain \n36:21 - Finishing walls\n37:46 - Timber roof\n39:31 - Tiling roof\n40:33 - Firing batch 4 and tiling\n43:46 - Firing batch 5 and tiling\n44:40 - Firing batch 6 and tiling\n46:01 - Finished hut\n46:28 - Hut in a rainstorm\n47:31 - Hearth fire in hut\n\nAbout Primitive Technology:\nPrimitive technology is a hobby where you build things in the wild completely from scratch using no modern tools or materials. These are the strict rules: If you want a fire, use a fire stick - An axe, pick up a stone and shape it - A hut, build one from trees, mud, rocks etc. The challenge is seeing how far you can go without utilizing modern technology. I do not live in the wild, but enjoy building shelter, tools, and more, only utilizing natural materials.

The magical music adventure journeys back to the timeless story with Rachel Zegler (“West Side Story”) in the title role and Gal Gadot (“Wonder Woman”) as her Stepmother, the Evil Queen.\n  \nThe new trailer showcases the scale and beauty of the lavish production design, the beloved characters Bashful, Doc, Dopey, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, and Sneezy, and a first look at the power ballad Waiting on a Wish, one of the all-new original songs from EGOT winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (“The Greatest Showman”).",
