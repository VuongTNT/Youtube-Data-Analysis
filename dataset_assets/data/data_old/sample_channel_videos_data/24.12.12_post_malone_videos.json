you lied to me\n\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me\nWe were on the low, but you were getting high with me\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n\nIt was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen (Oh)\nBut that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen (It's so cold)\nGot no patience no more (No)\nBeen waitin' too long (Yeah)\nYou hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch (Ayy)\nI heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake\nDidn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe (Damn)\nRemember when you got my ass arrested (Wow)\nAt least when I was in jail, I got some rest in (Yeah)\n\nOoh, I surrender (Ayy), time to forget ya (Ayy)\nI'm too tired to forgive ya (Ayy), it's too hard on my liver (Ayy)\nAnd you know (Ayy) it’s all (Ayy) over now\nAll your friends (Ayy), you know (Ayy) they sold you out\n\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (Die for me)\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (Lying to me)\nWe were on the low, but you were getting high with me (High with me)\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see (Side I see)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Lie, lie, lie)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Die, die, die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah (You lied, yeah)\n\nIt was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights\n9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight (Daylight)\nGot a bad girl, I was treating her too nice (I was treating her too nice)\nCaught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need (That ain't what I need)\nYou just sold your soul, girl, quit crying (Sold your soul)\nYour passport, it looks like you lying (Know you cold)\nYou broken down by your past, don't deny it (You know I know)\nYour ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah (Flying)\nWasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying (I was trying on ya)\nI did everything to reach out to you (I was reaching out)\nSaid you never had me caught up in no drama (No drama)\nI done ran into my karma (I done ran)\n\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me (That you would die)\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me (You'd been lying)\nWe been on the low, but you been getting high with me (You was high)\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see (A different side)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Said you'd die, you said you'd die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me (Now you're lying)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n\nSettle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough\nI came around, I figured out, should follow my gut\nI don't play anymore, I went through your phone\nAnd called the girls in your DMs and took all them home\nAnd I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me\nGrew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me\nTurns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows\nI sold 15 million copies of a break-up note\nBrought some strangers in our beds\nAnd now you lost your right to privacy\nSpilling all our secrets\nWhen you thought they'd probably die with me\nKnow you fucking love it on the low\nAnd you don't have to say I'm crazy\n'Cause I know nothing's changed though\n\nSaid you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nI had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)\nWe were on the low, but you were getting high with me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nWhen it's past 11, that's a different side I see\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nBut you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me\n(But you lied, you lied, you lied)\nSaid you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me\n(You'd die, you'd die, you'd die)\nBut you lied to me, ...",

I wonder\nI go out, and all they eyes on me\nI show out, do you like what you see?\nAnd now they closin' in on me\nLet 'em sharpen all they teeth\nThis is more than I can handle\nBlood in my Lambo'\nWish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope\nI light a candle, some Palo Santo\nFor all these demons, wish I could just go on\n\nI just keep on hopin' that you call me\nYou say you wanna see me, but you can't right now\nYou never took the time to get to know me\nWas scared of losin' somethin' that we never found\nWe're running out of reasons, but we can't let go\nYeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home\n\n#PostMalone #HollywoodsBleeding\n\nMusic video by Post Malone performing Hollywood's Bleeding (Audio). © 2019 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/FZwmfz",

Take me back to yesterday,\nWhen I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,\nThen was shot back down to Earth,\nWhen we met you ain’t know I was a singer,\nYou weren’t impressed by all the ice on my fingers, I had your mom and daddy’s house on my pinky,\nIf I’da known what it’d be like now,\nI wouldn’t be in misery right now, Look in the mirror I don’t see myself, Being with me has gotta be like hell,\nSo tell the devil I’ma be right down!\nYou keep me wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,\nI was caught up in your orbit,\nSpinning like a bullet,\nI was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger, Then I shot back down to earth,\nI keep wondering who’s the one replacing me? Take me back to yesterday,\nWhen I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,\nThen was shot back down to Earth,\nYeah I’m wrapped around, and around, and around on your finger now, You got me wrapped around, and around, and around on your finger now,\nI’ma be right down!\nYou keep me wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,\nI was caught up in your orbit,\nSpinning like a bullet,\nI was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger, Then I shot back down to earth,\nI keep wondering who’s the one replacing me?

(What's that to me, yeah)\n'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)\nIt's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch\nSo thank you for the grave (Yeah)\nI needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)\n\nAnd I don't wanna meet your mama (No)\nShe prolly crazier than you (She prolly crazier than you)\nI'm gonna need some thicker armor (Armor)\nTo spend another night with you (And on and on and on)\nBaby, I know just what to do\nEvery time you fuck me over, I'll come back to you\nBaby, I don't want to know the truth (Know the truth)\nI ignore them when they tell me all the shit you do (Shit you do)\nI always get my heart broke like I needed the practice (Needed)\nFoot on my throat 'til my world is collapsin' (Damn)\nBut this what I chose, it's the law of attraction, yeah (Attraction)\n(And on and on and on)\n\nYou make my life so hard (So hard, so hard)\nBut that's what gets me off\n\nI had a thousand bad times\nSo what's another time to me? (So what's that to me, yeah)\nYou try to burn my house down\nBut what's another house to me? (So what's that to me, yeah)\n'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)\nIt's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch (Kill me)\nSo thank you for the grave (Yeah)\nI needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)\n\nI should get out, but I still want more\nI should get out, what am I waitin' for?\nIt's all the same to me, it's all a game to me\nIt's all the same to me, it's all the same\n\nI had a thousand bad times\nSo what's another time to me? (What's that to me)\nYou try to burn my house down\nBut what's another house to me? (What's that to me)\n'Cause I can take anything that you give me (What you give me)\nIt's gonna take a lot more to kill me, bitch (Kill me)\nSo thank you for the grave (Yeah)\nI needed me a place to sleep (Place to sleep)\nWe go there, oh\n\n#PostMalone #AThousandBadTimes #HollywoodsBleeding\n\nMusic video by Post Malone performing A Thousand Bad Times (Audio). © 2019 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/pYlwGs",

        "description": "Post Malone - Overdrive | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast – and it’s always been that way. Listen to “White Iverson” again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‘beerbongs & bentleys’ and ‘Twelve Carat Toothache’ and you’ll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we’re waiting for ‘Austin,’ Posty’s latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it’s “some of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least – trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.” To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he’s leveling up once again, no doubt. Check this performance of “Overdrive,” one of the 17 songs from the new album, and stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

Need a lifeline right now, 99 nights tryna get my mind right now,\nLife is sour even when I’m in the limelight now, But I try somehow,\n          \nWhen I’m alone,\nPretend I’m letting you go, Just tell me who to blame, For this,\n          \nWhen waking up,\nFeels like a punch in the gut, Just tell me, who’s to blame, For this? \n\n#PostMalone #TwelveCaratToothache #WhenImAlone\n\nMusic video by Post Malone performing When I’m Alone (Lyric Video). © 2022 Mercury Records/Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/OfYX3r",

        "description": "Post Malone - Something Real | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast – and it’s always been that way. Listen to “White Iverson” again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‘beerbongs & bentleys’ and ‘Twelve Carat Toothache’ and you’ll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we’re waiting for ‘Austin,’ Posty’s latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it’s “some of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least – trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.” To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he’s leveling up once again, no doubt. This OLP performance of “Something Real” is our fantastic finale. Watch through to see if Post stays up on that roof. \n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

        "title": "Post Malone - AUSTIN (Official Live Performances) | Vevo",
        "description": "Post Malone - ‘AUSTIN’ Official Live Performances\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast – and it’s always been that way. Listen to “White Iverson” again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‘beerbongs & bentleys’ and ‘Twelve Carat Toothache’ and you’ll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we’re waiting for ‘Austin,’ Posty’s latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it’s “some of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least – trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.” To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. Geographically and emotionally, he does it all in these three performances - strumming a guitar poolside in “Green Thumb,” anguishing on the couch in “Overdrive,” and balancing on the roof in “Something Real.” Here’s to Post, here’s to Austin. \n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.

        "title": "Post Malone - Green Thumb (Official Live Performance) | Vevo",
        "description": "Post Malone - Green Thumb | Vevo Official Live Performance\n\nPost Malone was never simply one thing. His skills are as broad as his artistic vision is vast – and it’s always been that way. Listen to “White Iverson” again. That 2016 nugget was just as much a pop fever dream as it was a cornerstone of Soundcloud rap. Seems like our hero has been in perpetual evolution since day one. Connect the dots between ‘beerbongs & bentleys’ and ‘Twelve Carat Toothache’ and you’ll see a lot of territory being covered in a very logical and very compelling way. Now we’re waiting for ‘Austin,’ Posty’s latest and perhaps most revealing work to date (his real name is Austin Richard Post). It arrives July 28, and the singer has told fans that it’s “some of the most challenging and rewarding music for me, a least – trying to really push myself and really do some cool stuff.” To celebrate the arrival of his fifth full album, we united with Mr. Malone in SoCal last month. The results are stellar, with Post being deeply candid and deeply expressive for the cameras. With a fetching pop perspective, he’s leveling up once again, no doubt. This OLP performance of \"Green Thumb\" joins that of “Overdrive,” one of the 17 songs from the new album, which arrives today, July 28. Stay close as we roll out more performances soon.\n\nWatch music videos by Post Malone:  https://www.youtube.com/@postmalone\n\nFollow Post Malone:\nhttps://www.postmalone.com\nhttps://instagram.com/postmalone\nhttps://twitter.com/postmalone\nhttps://facebook.com/postmalone\nhttps://snapchat.com/add/postmalone\nhttps://tiktok.com/@postmalone\nhttps://discord.gg/post-malone\n\nFollow Vevo\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/vevo\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/vevo\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/vevo\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@vevo\n\nExecutive Producer: JP Evangelista\nExecutive Producer: Chris Pereira\nExecutive Producer: Jordy Wax\nDirectors: Skyler Brown & Seth Halter\nCreative Director, Production: Liz Hart\nLine Producer: Haley Sliger\nLine Producer: Stacey Branson\nProduction Manager: Cole Emery\nDirector Of Photography: Zoe Simone-Yi\nProduction Designer: Tyler Jensen\nMusic & Talent: Annie Shapiro + Sam Mackoff\n\nPresident, Mercury Records: Tyler Arnold\nEVP, Marketing Strategy, Republic Records: Marleny Reyes\nVP, Commerce, Republic Records: Ryan Stevens\nAssociate Director, Commerce (Video), Republic Records: Katie Baumstein\nSVP, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Tim Hrycyshyn\nSenior Director, Digital Strategy, Republic Records: Allegra Chautin\n\n1st AD: Derek Jaeschke\n2nd AD: Delaney Forrey\n1st AC: Pancho Ortiz\n2nd AC: Kate Ruthenbeck\nDIT: Shawn Aguilar\nSteadicam Operator: Jose Espinoza\nCrane Camera Operator: Chris Herr\nCrane Operator: Garrett Dorin\nCrane Tech: Nazariy Hatak\nRemote Head Tech: Alexandre Nunez\n\nGaffer: Nick Durr\nBB Electric: Jasper Khadjenouri\nElectric / Driver: Victor Noel Arenal\nElectric: Justin Roxbrough\nElectric: Rodolfo Martinez\nElectric: Isaac Han\nElectric: Charlie Hayes\nBoard Operator: Patrick Mattes\n\nKey Grip: Luke Poole\nBB Grip: Justen Hernandez\nGrip: Steven Albovias\nGrip: Nick Herman\nGrip: Grayson Venters\nGrip: Ryan Elvira\n\nArt Director: Danny Erb\nSet Decorator: Michael Coursey\nLeadman: Montana Bertoletti\nSet Dresser / Shopper: Christina Skilbred\nSet Dresser: Eric Moore\nSet Dresser: Kris Ingram\nScenic Painter: Jesse Hotchkiss\nSet Dresser: Abe Turner\n\nArtist Management: Dre London\nArtist Management: Bobby Greenleaf\nArtist Management: Austin Rosen\nProduction Manager, Artist: Dennis A.
