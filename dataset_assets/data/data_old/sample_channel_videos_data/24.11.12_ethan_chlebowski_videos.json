Focaccia bread is made with pantry staples that are mixed by hand, then let rest and folded, before proofing, adding dimples and topping with whatever you have for a crisp crust, and an open fluffy interior. Full recipe linked below.\n\n► Join our Cooking Community: https://community.ethanchlebowski.com/\n► Focaccia Recipe: https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/cooking-techniques-recipes/how-to-make-focaccia\n\nA couple of notes on this focaccia. I like using a fairly high hydration dough. For this recipe, my water amount is 75% of the flour.  This leads to focaccia with a thin, but really crisp crust and a soft interior with fairly large holes inside, this texture and size I find perfect for making sandwiches with. While the end product I prefer much more, a high hydration dough will naturally be really sticky and can be annoying to work with if you aren't used to it but don't worry I'll show you how.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n► Connect with me on social:\n - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/echleb/\n - TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@cookwithe\n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/EthanChleb\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n► CHEAP, but useful Kitchen Gear\n  - Whetstone for sharpening: https://amzn.to/35lvnuv\n  - Scale: https://amzn.to/2SMht25\n  - 8-inch Chef's knife: https://amzn.to/2QLYvWr\n  - Cast iron: https://amzn.to/2tu4Bmo\n  - Saucepan: https://amzn.to/2tu4Bmo\n  - Wood cutting board: https://amzn.to/2Qkw1UQ\n  - (NOT cheap) Amazing Pan: https://amzn.to/2rW8wYY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMISC.

Roasted vegetables are one of my favorite dishes to make due to their simple preparation, clean up and unparalleled complex flavors!\n\nFULL RECIPE BELOW\n\nInstagram: @echleb https://www.instagram.com/echleb/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n█ Smoked Paprika Roasted Vegetables Recipe █\n\nIngredients:\n• 1 Russet Potato\n• 1 Medium Yellow Onion\n• 2 Carrots, skinned\n• 1 TBSP Duck Fat (substitutes olive or peanut oil)\n• Salt to taste (A healthy couple pinches)\n• Pepper to taste (A healthy grind)\n• 2 TSP Smoked Paprika\n• 1 TBSP cilantro, minced\n• 1 TBSP lemon juice\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit\n\n2. Cut the potato, onion, and carrots into even cubes. In a mixing bowl, combine the vegetables, duck fat, and spices until they are well coated in fat. If needed, add more oil to completely coat.\n\n3. Turn the mixed vegetables onto a baking sheet. Completely space out the vegetables to avoid touching. This will allow the steam to escape and browning to occur.\n\n4. Put the vegetables in the oven and roast for 20-25 minutes total, stirring them 3 times over the course of roasting (every 5-10 minutes).\n\n5. While the vegetables are roasting, mix the lime juice and cilantro.\n\n6. Pull the roasted vegetables out of the oven and transfer to your mixing bowl from earlier.\n\n7. Add a spoonful of the lemon juice and cilantro mixture. Stir to combine and serve immediately.\n\nENJOY!\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nMusic:\nSmokin' in Seattle by Crazy Jazz\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/eddyfradet/smokin-in-seattle #homecooking #f52grams",

        "description": "► Support my work on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/EthanC\n\nDo you know how many recipes require diced onion? Regardless though, countless recipes require the use of diced onion, but what's the best way to do it? \n\nToday, we are going to explore the 3 main ways to dice an onion in the home kitchen, the traditional 3-way dice, the radial, and what I like to call the lazy dice. Each one has its own benefits such as speed or even cutting, but at the end of the video, I will let you know my verdict on which one is the best.\n\nFirst up is the traditional way. This is the most common one that is taught by chef's around the world and it's the method shown in the Professional Chef by the Culinary Institute of America.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n► Connect with me on social:\n - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/echleb/\n - TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@cookwithe\n - Twitter: https://twitter.com/EthanChleb\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n► Cheap, but useful Kitchen Gear\n  - Whetstone for sharpening: https://amzn.to/35lvnuv\n  - Scale: https://amzn.to/2SMht25\n  - 8 inch Chef's knife: https://amzn.to/2QLYvWr\n  - Cast iron: https://amzn.to/2tu4Bmo\n  - Saucepan: https://amzn.to/2tu4Bmo\n  - Wood cutting board: https://amzn.to/2Qkw1UQ\n  - (NOT cheap) Amazing Pan: https://amzn.to/2rW8wYY\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMISC.

There are 4 basic variables that lead to a good steak in my opinion.\n  1. Good quality beef\n  2. Salted appropriately\n  3. Cooked correctly\n  4. Nice sear\nUsing a temperature gauge like a thermometer or sous video makes it simple to nail a perfect steak.\n\nSteak\nSteak doneness\nHow to test the doneness of a steak\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMISC.

        "description": "Everyone should know how to make carnitas, specifically, this make-ahead version just makes sense for the home cook. It's literally, cut up pork chunks, add salt, add water, cook until tender and crisp up beautifully.
